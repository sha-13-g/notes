---------------------------

This is aria2, a major mode for controlling aria2c downloader
Currrently supported download types are: bittorrent, magnet, meta4, ftp, http, https files (basically what aria2c supports). There is no support for changing global or per-download options, but this is planned.

This mode tries to work well with evil-mode, just set aria2-add-evil-quirks to t.
