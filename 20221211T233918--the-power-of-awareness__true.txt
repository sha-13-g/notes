Conciousness is the fondation of all. The origan of experience, sensations, emotion, thought is born out of conciousness

Me and my word are one. The word around me is the state on my mind.

Difference doesn't mean different cause but different arrangement of the same cause, which is my conciousness

My mind is arranged of the image of all of my beliefs and what i consent as true.
The only reality is my own conciousness.  If something isn't right that must be because that the way it's in my mind.

Health, beauty, wealth, success is not created; everything is already created. For it to be manifested the arrangement of my mind need to go that way-That is the concept of myself, and the concepts of myself is all that i accept and consent as true. What i consent and accept as true is revealed in my action.


The root of every transformation is desire, a burning desire to change.
I must want to change and intend to before any transformation takes place.

To be the person that i wish to be, i must assume that i'm already this person and persist in it until it became the dominant state of my mind, i must to fidele to the assumption that i make that it will manifest through acts

My imagination is the a powerfull instrument, the means by which i design my world 

The ideal that i want will not be manifested until i imagine that i'm already that ideal.
For my ideals to be realize i need to abandon myself to it, to fall into it without any reserve.

To manifeste my dreams, i need:
	- First clearly determine what that dream is.
    - Second imagine that it's already fullfiled
    - Third my attention need to be firmly and repeadly focused on the dream.
